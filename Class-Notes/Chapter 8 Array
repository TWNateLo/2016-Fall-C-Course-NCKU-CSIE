/**************************************************************CHAPTER 8 ARRAY********************************************************/

First one is x[0]

array + link list ---> best efficiency (Data Structure Course)

Compiler will not check array for you. (There is no dynamic check in C --> Ada, C++ will check it)
---> Notice the boundary!!!

Components that have no initial value in an array are set as 0

Designated Initializers
int a[15] = {[2] = 29, [9] = 7, [14] = 48};
